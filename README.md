# Simon-Game

Have some fun, kill some time, test your memory with the classic game called Simon!

If you're unfamiliar with this game its very easy. In the beginning one square will light up. You click that square, then another square lights up (this is now level 2), and you have to click the first square that lit up and now this current square that lit up. Once you click the first and second square you move on to level 3 where another square lights up and now you have to click all three squares in the same order they came. This continues until you click the wrong square and get the sequence wrong.
